    <string name="about">
        This application helps you to manage your passwords by remembering them for you. You can set a single master password
        to unlock all your passwords and can copy them directly to the clip-board. \n \n
        Auto-suggestion  provides you a secure hashed password which can be stored, thus, providing high levels of security. \n\n
        The application is still in beta-testing phase so please send the suggestions to \'nawazmohtashim@gmail.com\' or contribute
        at \'github.com/mohtashim-nawaz/PasswordManager\' \n\n
        Please name all your accounts differently.
